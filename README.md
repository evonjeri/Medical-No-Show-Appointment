# Medical-No-Show-Appointment
This analysis is part of my Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program that I took and aims to explore a dataset containing aproximately 100k medical appointments from the Brazilian public health system.  I found insights about the problem, reviewed and communicated.I focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. **
